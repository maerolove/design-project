# Project documentation

This repository uses KolkhozIO/rulez as the source of shared engineering guidelines for design, coding, testing, and documentation.

- Upstream guidelines live at: https://github.com/KolkhozIO/rulez
- A vendored copy is kept under docs/rulez to make the rules easily accessible in this repo.
- The copy can be updated at any time using the sync script below.

## Where to start

1) Read docs/rulez/README.md for the full guidelines.
2) For tasks and changes in this project, also read the repositoryâ€™s .cursorrules at the root. It summarizes key rules tailored for this codebase and for AI-assisted editing.

## Keeping rulez up to date

We support two integration modes:

- Submodule mode (preferred when enabled): docs/rulez is a Git submodule that tracks https://github.com/KolkhozIO/rulez
- Vendored mode (default in this repo): docs/rulez contains a snapshot of README.md, rules/, and examples/ from upstream

Use the provided Node script to sync in either mode:

```bash
# From the repo root
node scripts/sync-rulez.mjs                 # auto-detect mode
node scripts/sync-rulez.mjs --mode=vendor   # force vendored snapshot update
node scripts/sync-rulez.mjs --mode=submodule# update submodule and pull latest
```

If you switch to submodules later, add a submodule via HTTPS:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/KolkhozIO/rulez docs/rulez
# Then future updates are as simple as:
node scripts/sync-rulez.mjs --mode=submodule
```

## Conventions to keep in mind

- Formatting: see .editorconfig and Prettier configuration (.prettierrc). Use LF line endings and a trailing newline.
- Units for the upcoming 3D editor: work in meters, Y-up coordinate system, default grid snap 0.1 m.
- See .cursorrules for a curated summary of code style, architecture, testing, docs, performance, and accessibility expectations.
