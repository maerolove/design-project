# Three Editor Scaffold (Governance setup)

This repository is preparing rules and project governance ahead of the main application scaffolding.

- No application features are introduced in this task.
- The focus here is integrating development guidelines and templates to streamline future work.

## Rules & Guidelines

- Upstream rules: see docs/rulez (vendored from https://github.com/KolkhozIO/rulez)
- Local summary for AI tooling and humans: see ./.cursorrules
- Project docs entrypoint: ./docs/README.md

To refresh upstream rules locally:

```bash
node scripts/sync-rulez.mjs
```

## Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md for the workflow used by this project and how it ties to the rulez guidelines.

## Status

Governance and templates are set up first. Application components and code scaffolding will be handled in a subsequent task.
